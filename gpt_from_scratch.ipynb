    "**GPT** stands for **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**. It's the technology behind ChatGPT and many other AI chatbots. But what does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative**: It can *generate* (create) new text, like writing a story or answering a question\n",
    "- **Pre-trained**: It learned from reading billions of words before you use it\n",
    "- **Transformer**: The type of neural network architecture it uses (we'll build this!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Will You Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a **tiny GPT model from scratch**! By the end, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: How computers turn words into numbers\n",
    "2. **Embeddings**: How those numbers become meaningful representations\n",
    "3. **Attention**: How the model decides which words are important\n",
    "4. **Neural Networks**: The basic building blocks of AI\n",
    "5. **Training**: How the model learns from examples\n",

    "3. **Self-Attention**: The mechanism that makes Transformers powerful\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**: How neural networks learn from mistakes\n",

    "\n",
    "Want to make it better? Try:\n",
    "1. **More training data**: Use longer texts (books, articles)\n",
    "2. **Bigger model**: More layers, larger embeddings\n",
    "3. **Better tokenization**: Use BPE (byte-pair encoding) instead of words\n",
    "4. **GPU training**: Much faster than CPU\n",
    "5. **Learning rate scheduling**: Start fast, slow down later\n",
    "6. **Dropout**: Randomly turn off neurons to prevent overfitting"
