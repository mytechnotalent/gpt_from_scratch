    "| Component | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| **Token Embedding** | Converts word IDs to dense vectors that capture word meaning |\n",
    "| **Position Embedding** | Adds positional information so the model knows word order |\n",
    "| **Self-Attention** | Allows tokens to \"look at\" other tokens and gather information |\n",
    "| **Multi-Head Attention** | Runs multiple attention heads to capture different patterns |\n",
    "| **Feed-Forward Network** | Processes each token independently with non-linearity |\n",
    "| **Residual Connections** | Helps gradient flow and training stability |\n",
    "| **Layer Normalization** | Normalizes activations for stable training |\n",
    "| **Language Model Head** | Converts final representations to word predictions |\n",

    "### Key Differences from Production GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Our TinyGPT is small for educational purposes. Real GPT models have:\n",
    "- **More layers**: GPT-3 has 96 layers, we have 2\n",
    "- **Larger embeddings**: GPT-3 uses 12,288 dimensions, we use 32\n",
    "- **More attention heads**: GPT-3 has 96 heads, we have 2\n",
    "- **Bigger vocabulary**: GPT-3 has ~50,000 tokens, we have ~40 words\n",
    "- **More training data**: GPT-3 trained on hundreds of billions of words!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this model, you could:\n",
    "1. Use a larger corpus (download books, Wikipedia, etc.)\n",
    "2. Increase model size (more layers, larger embeddings)\n",
    "3. Use subword tokenization (BPE) instead of word-level\n",
    "4. Add dropout for regularization\n",
    "5. Train on a GPU with larger batch sizes\n",
    "6. Implement learning rate scheduling"
